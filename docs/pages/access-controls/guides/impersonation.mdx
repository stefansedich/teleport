title: Impersonating Teleport Users
description: How to issue short-lived certs on behalf of Teleport users using impersonation.
---

# Impersonation

Sometimes users need to create short-lived certificates for non-interactive users, for example, CI/CD systems.
Your programs interacting with Teleport may need to create their own authentication as well.
Teleport's impersonation allows users and robots to create short-lived certs for other users and roles.

Let's explore how interactive user Alice can create credentials for a non-interactive
CI/CD user Jenkins and a security scanner.

## Prerequisites

- Installed [Teleport](../getting-started.mdx) or [Teleport Cloud](../../cloud/introduction.mdx) >= (=teleport.version=)
- [Tctl admin tool](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) >= (=teleport.version=)

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  The examples below may include the use of the `sudo` keyword to make following each step easier when creating resources from scratch. However, we generally discourage the use of `sudo` in customer-facing production environments per the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP). 
</Admonition>

Verify that your Teleport client is connected:

```bash
sudo tctl status

# Cluster  acme.example.com
# Version  6.0.2
# Host CA  never updated
# User CA  never updated
# Jwt CA   never updated
# CA pin   sha256:e63c7c44be468d37a5b0276b70e9d10b17f24f4be19d6b579810fc94eaa31783
```

## Step 1/3. Create a CI/CD user

First, let's create a user `jenkins`. Notice parameter `max_session_ttl` that limits
cert duration for this user at 10 days. As a rule of thumb, the shorter the TTL, the better.

Save this file as `jenkins.yaml` and create a user and a role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: jenkins
spec:
  # SSH options used for user sessions
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of SSH certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 240h

  # The allow section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default, nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    logins: ['jenkins']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
---
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: jenkins
spec:
  roles: ['jenkins']
```

  Here and below follow along and create yaml resources using `tctl create -f`:

  ```bash
  sudo tctl create -f jenkins.yaml
  ```
</Admonition>

## Step 2/3. Create an impersonator

Let's create a role `impersonator`. Save this role as `impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: impersonator
spec:
  # SSH options used for user sessions
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of SSH certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  # The allow section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. by default nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ['jenkins']
      roles: ['jenkins']

  # The deny section uses the identical format as the 'allow' section.
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Create an interactive user `alice` who can access the cluster
and impersonate `jenkins`. We assigned a preset `access` role that allows users to access clusters for
Alice's convenience.

```bash
sudo tctl users add alice  --roles=impersonator,access
```

Alice can login using `tsh` and issue a cert for `jenkins`:

```bash
tsh login --proxy=teleport.localhost:3080 --user=alice --auth=local
sudo tctl auth sign --user=jenkins --format=openssh --out=jenkins --ttl=240h
```

Here is an example of how Alice can use the keys:

```bash
# Start a fresh SSH agent for this session
eval $(ssh-agent)
# Adds cert to the agent
ssh-add jenkins
# ssh into the node as jenkins
ssh -J jenkins@teleport.localhost:3023 -p 3022 jenkins@127.0.0.1
```

<Admonition

  Teleport's `session.start` event will capture an action done
  by `alice` who is impersonating `jenkins`.
  ```
  session.start event:session.start impersonator:alice login:jenkins user:jenkins
  ```
  The SSH certificate issued for `jenkins` contains information
  about impersonator - `alice`.
</Admonition>

### Impersonation rules

To prevent unintended consequences, Teleport defines the following impersonation rules:

- Even though Alice's `max_session_ttl` is 10 hours, she can issue a cert with a longer TTL of 240 hours,
because `jenkins` role allows it. A certificate's TTL issued using impersonation is limited to the `max_session_ttl` of the roles being impersonated.
- Even in case if `jenkins` role could impersonate some other roles, Alice would not be able
to use this permission. Teleport prevents impersonating users recursively.
- Alice can get a new `jenkins` certificate with the same TTL, but metadata updated, for example
pointing to a different Teleport leaf cluster.
Teleport allows impersonated users to renew their certificates with the reduced scope of the certificate.

## Step 3/3. Dynamic impersonation

Sometimes you don't know in advance what roles will be created by the system.

You can use `where` condition to allow one role to impersonate other roles
based on matching labels.

Save the role `security-impersonator` in a file `security-impersonator.yaml` and create it using `tctl`.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: security-impersonator
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  # Allow security-impersonator to impersonate any user and role with group: security label
  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ['*']
      roles: ['*']
      where: 'equals(impersonate_role.metadata.labels["group"], "security") && equals(impersonate_user.metadata.labels["group"], "security")'

  # The deny section uses the identical format as the 'allow' section.
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

```bash
sudo tctl create -f security-impersonator.yaml
sudo tctl users update alice --set-roles=security-impersonator,access
```

Alice can now impersonate any role and user with a label `group: security`.

Create a user and a role `security-scanner`. Save a file `security-scanner.yaml` and create user and group:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: scanner
  labels:
    group: security
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  allow:
    logins: ['root']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
---
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: security-scanner
  labels:
    group: security
spec:
  roles: ['security-scanner']
```

Alice can issue certificates for a security scanner:

``` bash
sudo tctl auth sign --user=security-scanner --format=openssh --out=security-scanner --ttl=10h
```

**Matching user traits**

We can make the `security-impersonator` role more flexible by matching source user and target role parameters:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: security-impersonator
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ['*']
      roles: ['*']
      where: 'contains(user.spec.traits["group"], impersonate_role.metadata.labels["group"]) && contains(user.spec.traits["group"], impersonate_user.metadata.labels["group"])'

  # The deny section uses the identical format as the 'allow' section.
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

This role will work with SSO users, but we can test locally, by updating Alice's account
entry with traits:

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  traits:
    group: ['security', 'devops']
  roles:
  - security-impersonator
  - access
```

```bash
# Once Alice logs in again, she will receive a new certificate with updated roles.
tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=alice --auth=local
# Alice can now get a certificate for the security scanner
sudo tctl auth sign --user=security-scanner --format=openssh --out=security-scanner --ttl=10h
```
