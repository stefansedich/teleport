# Getting Started

In Teleport, any local, SSO, or robot user can be a member of one or several
roles. Roles govern access to databases, SSH servers, kubernetes clusters, and web apps.

We will start with local users and preset roles, map SSO users to roles and wrap up
with creating your own role.

## Prerequisites

- Installed [Teleport](../getting-started.mdx) or [Teleport Cloud](../cloud/introduction.mdx) >= (=teleport.version=)
- [Tctl admin tool](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) >= (=teleport.version=)

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  The examples below may include the use of the `sudo` keyword to make following each step easier when creating resources from scratch. However, we generally discourage the use of `sudo` in customer-facing production environments per the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP). 
</Admonition>

Verify that your Teleport client is connected:

```bash
sudo tctl status

# Cluster  acme.example.com
# Version  6.0.2
# Host CA  never updated
# User CA  never updated
# Jwt CA   never updated
# CA pin   sha256:e63c7c44be468d37a5b0276b70e9d10b17f24f4be19d6b579810fc94eaa31783
```

## Step 1/3. Add local users with preset roles

Teleport provides a couple of preset roles: `admin`, `editor`, `auditor`, and `access`.
Members of `editor` role can modify cluster configuration, members of the `auditor` role can view audit logs, and `access` members can access cluster resources. Members of `admin`, are full cluster administrators.

Invite a local user Alice as cluster `editor`:

```bash
sudo tctl users add alice --roles=editor
```

Once Alice signs up, she will be able to edit cluster configuration. You can list
users and their roles using `tctl users ls`.

```bash
sudo tctl users ls

# User                 Roles
# -------------------- -------------- 
# alice                editor
# admin@example.com    admin
```

You can update user's roles using `tctl users update` command:

```bash
# Once Alice logs back in, she will be able to view audit logs
sudo tctl users update alice --set-roles=editor,auditor
```

Because Alice has two roles, permissions from those roles create a union -
she will be able to act as a system administrator and auditor at the same time.

## Step 2/3. Map SSO users to roles

We're now going to set up a GitHub connector for Teleport Open Source Edition and Okta for Teleport Enterprise Edition.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Open Source">
    Save the file below as `github.yaml` and update the fields. You will need to set up
    [Github OAuth 2.0 Connector](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) app.
    Any member belonging to the Github organization `octocats` and on team `admin` will be able to assume a built-in role `access`.

    ```yaml
    kind: github
    version: v3
    metadata:
      # connector name that will be used with `tsh --auth=github login`
      name: github
    spec:
      # client ID of Github OAuth app
      client_id: client-id
      # client secret of Github OAuth app
      client_secret: client-secret
      # This name will be shown on UI login screen
      display: Github
      # Change tele.example.com to your domain name
      redirect_url: https://tele.example.com:443/v1/webapi/github/callback
      # Map github teams to teleport roles
      teams_to_logins:
        - organization: octocats # Github organization name
          team: admin            # Github team name within that organization
          # map github admin team to Teleport's "access" role
          logins: ["access"]
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Enterprise">
    Follow [SAML Okta Guide](../enterprise/sso/ssh-okta.mdx#configure-okta) to create a SAML app.
    Check out [OIDC guides](../enterprise/sso/oidc.mdx#identity-providers) for OpenID Connect apps.
    Save the file below as `okta.yaml` and update the `acs` field.
    Any member in Okta group `okta-admin` will assume a built-in role `admin`.

    ```yaml
    kind: saml
    version: v2
    metadata:
      name: okta
    spec:
      acs: https://tele.example.com/v1/webapi/saml/acs
      attributes_to_roles:
      - {name: "groups", value: "okta-admin", roles: ["access"]}
      entity_descriptor: |
        <?xml !!! Make sure to shift all lines in XML descriptor
        with 4 spaces, otherwise things will not work
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/3. Create a custom role

Let's create a custom role for interns. Interns will have access
to test or staging SSH servers as `readonly` users. We will let them
view some monitoring web applications and dev kubernetes cluster.

Save this role as `interns.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: interns
spec:
  allow:
    # Logins configures SSH login principals
    logins: ['readonly']
    # Assigns members of this role to built-in kubernetes group view
    kubernetes_groups: ["view"]
    # Allow access to SSH nodes, kubernetes clusters, apps or databases labeled with staging or test
    node_labels:
      'env': ['staging', 'test']
    kubernetes_labels:
      'env': 'dev'
    app_labels:
      'type': ['monitoring']
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    # deny access to any node, database, app or kubernetes cluster labeled
    # as prod as any user.
    node_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    kubernetes_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    db_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    app_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
```

Create a role using `tctl create -f` command:

```bash
sudo tctl create -f /tmp/interns.yaml
# Get a list of all roles in the system
sudo tctl get roles --format text
```
