## Introduction

Here are examples of access policies you can define with Teleport:

- Analytics team members can SSH into the MongoDB read replica, but not main database.
- Interns can't access production databases.
- Devops can access production server only when using a registered U2F hardware token.
- Members of my team can access prod Kubernetes cluster if approved by someone else from the team.

RBAC is almost always used in conjunction with Single Sign-On, Github in OSS and OIDC or SAML in Enterprise
editions. It also works with users stored in Teleport's internal database.

### How does it work?

Let's assume a company is using [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) to authenticate users and place
them into groups. A typical deployment of Teleport in this scenario
would look like this:

1. Configure Teleport to use existing user identities stored in Okta.
2. Okta would have users placed in certain groups, perhaps "developers", "admins", "contractors", etc.
3. Teleport would have certain *Teleport roles* defined. For example: "developers" and "admins".
4. Mappings would connect the Okta groups (SAML assertions) to the Teleport roles.
   Every Teleport user will be assigned a *Teleport role* based on their Okta
   group membership.
