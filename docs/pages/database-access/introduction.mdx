# Database Access

Teleport can provide secure access to PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, while
improving both access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with Database Access:

- Users can retrieve short-lived database certificates using single sign-on
  flow thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [access request](../enterprise/workflow/index.mdx) workflows.
- Capture database access events as well as query activity in the audit log.

## Demo

Let's connect to a PostgreSQL server with `psql` and pgAdmin 4 after authenticating
with Github, execute a few SQL queries and observe them in the audit log:
