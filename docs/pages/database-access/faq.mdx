# Database Access FAQ

## Which database protocols does Teleport Database Access support?

Teleport Database Access currently supports PostgreSQL and MySQL protocols, with MongoDB protocol support coming in [Teleport 7.0](../preview/upcoming-releases.mdx#teleport-70-stockholm).

For PostgreSQL and MySQL, both self-hosted and cloud-hosted versions such as AWS RDS, Aurora (except for the Serverless version which doesn't support IAM auth), Redshift, and GCP Cloud SQL are supported. See available [guides](./guides.mdx) for all supported configurations.

## Which PostgreSQL protocol features are not supported?

The following PostgreSQL protocol features aren't currently supported:

- [Canceling requests in progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#id-1.10.5.7.9). Cancel requests issued by the PostgreSQL clients connected to Teleport proxy won't be passed to the database server.
- Any of the [authentication methods](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html) except for client certificate authentication and IAM authentication for cloud databases.

## Can database clients use public addresses that aren't their web public address?

Teleport administrators can set `postgres_public_addr` and `mysql_public_addr` proxy configuration fields to public addresses over which respective database clients should connect. See [Proxy Configuration](./reference/configuration.mdx#proxy-configuration)
for more details.

This is useful when Teleport web proxy UI is running behind an L7 load balancer (e.g. Amazon Load Balancer in AWS) in which case PostgreSQL/MySQL proxy needs to be exposed on a plain TCP load balancer (e.g. NLB in AWS).

## Do you support database client X?

Teleport relies on client certificates for authentication so any database client that supports this method of authentication and uses modern TLS (1.2+) should work.

Standard command-line clients such as `psql` and `mysql` are supported, there are also instructions for configuring select [graphical clients](./guides/gui-clients.mdx).

## When will you support database X?

We're focusing on PostgreSQL and MySQL initially, and adding MongoDB support in
[Teleport 7.0](../preview/upcoming-releases.mdx#teleport-70-stockholm). We plan to eventually support more databases in the future based on customer input and demand.
