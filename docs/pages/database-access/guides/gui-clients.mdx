# Graphical Database Clients

This article describes how to configure various graphical database clients to work with Teleport Database Access.

Pick the client you're interested in from the table of contents on the right.

## pgAdmin 4

[pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is a popular graphical client for PostgreSQL servers.

pgAdmin runs as a server that stores connection information for databases and serves a management web UI. As such, the pgAdmin server must run on the machine where `tsh db login` is executed, have access to the Certificate Authority, and the client certificate/key pair produced by that command.

To configure a new connection, right-click on "Servers" in the main browser view and create a new server:

![pgAdmin Add Server](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-add-server@2x.png)

In the "General" tab of the new server dialog, enter the server connection name:

![pgAdmin General](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-general@2x.png)

In the "Connection" tab, enter the default database name (`Maintenance DB`) and the connection service name, same as when you specify connecting using `psql`. Leave all the other fields blank:

![pgAdmin Connection](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-connection@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set the SSL mode to "full":

![pgAdmin SSL](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-ssl@2x.png)

Click "Save" and pgAdmin should immediately connect.

## MySQL Workbench

[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a visual tool that provides comprehensive MySQL administration and SQL development tools.

To connect to a database using MySQL Workbench, first retrieve the database credentials using `tsh db login` command. After logging in, take a note of the database configuration parameters shown by the `tsh db config` command:

```bash
tsh db config
# Name:      aurora
# Host:      root.gravitational.io
# Port:      3036
# User:      r0mant
# Database:
# CA:        /Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/certs.pem
# Cert:      /Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/r0mant-db/root/aurora-x509.pem
# Key:       /Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/r0mant
```

In the MySQL Workbench "Setup New Connection" dialog, fill out `Connection Name`, `Hostname`, `Port`, and `Username`:

In the "SSL" tab, set the SSL mode to "Require and Verify Identity" and enter the paths to the Certificate Authority, certificate, and private key files from `tsh db config` command:

![MySQL Workbench SSL](../../../img/database-access/workbench-ssl@2x.png)

Optionally, click "Test Connection" to verify connectivity:

Save the connection, and connect to the database.
