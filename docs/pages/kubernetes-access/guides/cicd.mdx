## Short-Lived Certs for Kubernetes CI/CD

CI/CD tools like Jenkins can use short-lived certificates to talk to the Kubernetes API.

Create a non-interactive local Teleport user. 

Non-interactive users don't have username or password defined and can't log in, but can be used
to create credentials.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: robot
spec:
  # The allow section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default, nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    # This field is used for SSH logins. You have to keep 'logins' as a non-empty random value
    # for Kubernetes to work until we fix it.
    logins: ['keep any value here']
    # A list of kubernetes groups to assign
    kubernetes_groups: ['system:masters']
---
kind: user
version: v3
metadata:
  name: jenkins
spec:
  roles:
  - robot
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  The examples below may include the use of the `sudo` keyword to make following each step easier when creating resources from scratch. However, we generally discourage the use of `sudo` in customer-facing production environments per the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP).

Generate a `kubeconfig` using the `jenkins` user and its roles using [`tctl auth sign`](../../cli-docs.mdx#tctl-auth-sign):

```bash
# Create a new local user for Jenkins
sudo tctl users add jenkins --roles=robot
# Creates a token for 25hrs
sudo tctl auth sign --user=jenkins --format=kubernetes --out=kubeconfig --ttl=25h

#  The credentials have been written to kubeconfig

cat kubeconfig
#   apiVersion: v1
#   clusters:
#   - cluster:
#      certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZ....
# This kubeconfig can now be exported and will provide access to the automation tooling.

# Uses kubectl to get pods, using the provided kubeconfig.
kubectl --kubeconfig /path/to/kubeconfig get pods
```

>
  Short-lived certificates expire in hours or minutes. You don't have to revoke them if the host gets compromised.
  Generate a new kubeconfig every hour using `tctl` or [API](../../reference/api/introduction.mdx)
  and publish it to secret storage, like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) or
  [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) secret managers.
