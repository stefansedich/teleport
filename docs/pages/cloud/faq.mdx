### Can I use Teleport Cloud Preview in production?

We expect Teleport Cloud to be suitable to use in non-mission-critical systems that do not require 24/7 access or a guaranteed SLA. 

We recommend a fallback option be available in the event of error or outage.

### Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?

We use AWS-managed keys. 

Currently, there is no option to provide your own key.

### Is this Teleport's S3 bucket or my bucket based on my AWS credentials?

It's a Teleport-managed S3 bucket with AWS-managed keys.

Currently, there is no way to provide your own bucket.

### How do I add nodes to Teleport Cloud?

You can connect servers, kubernetes clusters, databases and applications using [reverse tunnels](../admin-guide.mdx#adding-a-node-located-behind-nat).

There is no need to open any ports on your infrastructure for inbound traffic.

### How can I access the tctl admin tool?

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  The examples below may include the use of the `sudo` keyword to make following each step easier when creating resources from scratch. However, we generally discourage the use of `sudo` in customer-facing production environments per the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP). 
</Admonition>

We have made changes to allow you to log into your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl` remotely:

```bash
tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh:443
# tctl (Enterprise edition) can use tsh credentials as of version 5.0
sudo tctl status
```

### Are dynamic node tokens available?

After [connecting](#how-can-i-access-the-tctl-admin-tool) `tctl` to Teleport Cloud, users can generate
[dynamic tokens](../admin-guide.mdx#short-lived-dynamic-tokens):

```bash
sudo tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node,proxy --token=$(uuid)
```

### When will a security audit be available?

The Teleport Cloud security audit starts in January.

We'll work on fixing any security issues that are identified and publish them in Q1 2021.

### What does Teleport Cloud run in?

Teleport Cloud is deployed using a [Gravity](https://github.com/gravitational/gravity)
cluster on AWS.

### Will Teleport be automatically upgraded with each release?

We will be upgrading the preview version of Teleport Cloud automatically.

We will add an option to trigger upgrades manually and automatically within a configurable maintenance window.

### Does your SOCII report include Teleport Cloud?

Our current SOCII Type2 report covers our organization, Teleport and Gravity Open Source, and Enterprise Enterprise.

We are pursuing SOC2 for Cloud and expect to receive our report at the end of Q2 2021 after our 6 month audit period is completed.

### Can a customer deploy multiple clusters in Teleport Cloud?

Not at this time.

### Is FIPS mode an option?

FIPS is not currently an option for Teleport Cloud clusters.

### How do you store passwords?

Password hashes are generated using
[Golang's bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).

### How does Teleport manage web certificates? Can I upload my own?

Teleport uses [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/) to issue
certificates for every customer. 

It's not possible to upload a custom certificate or use a custom domain name.

### Do you encrypt data at rest?

Each deployment is using at-rest encryption using AWS DynamoDB and S3 at-rest encryption for customer data including session recordings and user records.
