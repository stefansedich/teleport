## Security

We have designed the Teleport Cloud environment to be secure; and, security is an ongoing process of improvement.

Our team routinely scrutinizes, reviews, updates, improves upon, and executes our security roadmap by working with independent security auditors to identify any gaps.

Teleport Cloud only gets the green light for use in strict compliance use-cases only when the team has full confidence that all security gaps or vulnerabilities have been identified and resolved.

## Compliance

A SOC2 audit is presently underway and should be concluded by June 2021.

## Managed Teleport Settings

SSH sessions are recorded [on nodes](../architecture/nodes.mdx#session-recording).

Teleport Cloud Proxy does not terminate SSH sessions when using OpenSSH and `tsh` sessions. The Cloud Proxy terminates TLS for Application, Database, and Kubernetes sessions.

## Data retention

The session recordings are stored in S3 using at-rest encryption. We have yet to define specific retention policies.

Customer data, including audit logging, is backed up using the DynamoDB "point in time recovery" system. Data can be recovered for up to 35 days. This retention period is not configurable.

## High Availability

Clusters are deployed in a single AWS region in 2 availability zones.
AWS guarantees [99.99%](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/) of monthly uptime percentage.

Teleport Cloud preview version does not commit to any SLA. It sets the availability objective to 99.7% of the monthly uptime percentage (a maximum of two hours of downtime per month).

Our goal is to achieve 99.99% uptime once Teleport Cloud graduates preview.
