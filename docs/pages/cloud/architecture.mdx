## Security

We have designed the Teleport Cloud environment to be secure; however we are still in the process of
scrutinizing and executing on our security roadmap and working with independent security
auditors to identify any gaps. Only once this is complete, the team will evaluate
whether the Teleport Cloud is ready for strict compliance use-cases.

## Compliance

We are going through SOC2 audit that should wrap up by June 2021.

## Managed Teleport Settings

SSH sessions are recorded [on nodes](../architecture/nodes.mdx#session-recording).
Teleport Cloud Proxy does not terminate SSH sessions when using OpenSSH and `tsh` sessions.
The Cloud Proxy terminates TLS for Application, Database and Kubernetes sessions.

## Data retention

The session recordings are stored in S3 using at-rest encryption.
We have yet to define specific retention policies.

Customer data, including audit logging, is backed up using the DynamoDB
"point in time recovery" system. Data can be recovered up to 35 days.
This retention period is not configurable.

## High Availability

Clusters are deployed in a single AWS region in 2 availability zones.
AWS guarantees [99.99%](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/) of monthly uptime percentage.

Teleport Cloud preview version does not commit to any SLA. It sets availability
objective to 99.7% of monthly uptime percentage (a maximum of two hours of downtime per month).

Our goal is to achieve 99.99% uptime once Teleport Cloud graduates preview.
